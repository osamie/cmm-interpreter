This is the front end of my compiler (which handles tokenization and parsing of my "cmm" language).

The grammar and token files can be found in "src/cmm.g" and "src/cmm.t".  

The focus was to develop the interpreter to be able to parse certain expressions and cmm syntax.

Sicc was used in generating the parse tree from the definition files.
